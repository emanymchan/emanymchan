- Hi, I’m Eman, a recent graduate of Business Analytics.
- I’m thrived to become a Business/Data Analyst.
- I have completed Master's in Business Analytics in 2024, specializing in AI for business.
- Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/eman-chan-5545211b2/
- Pronouns: she/her
- Fun fact: I am a marketing bachelor, but I did better in statistics than marketing units when I was doing my Bachelor's degree.
- After years of working, I think it's time to learn something new. I am not from a tech background, but I was inspired by my bro, who is a software developer, to get into the analytics field. My study journey for my Master's degree has proven again I am actually better when working with numbers.
